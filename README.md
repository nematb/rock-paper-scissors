# Rock Paper Scissors

Implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors smart contract in Solidity.



## Rules
* 2 parties must play
* Each party must pay 1 ETH to participate in the contract
* Possible moves are:
  * rock
  * paper
  * scissors



## Getting Started

RockPaperScissors.sol script was written using Remix online IDE.

Compile the script using Remix and click on "Deploy" button. Four visible click options are shown. First contract party can join by setting the value to 1 ETH and clicking "join".  To make the move, the party should write their choice and click on "makeMove". If the party is not sure about the spelling or if some letter should be capitalized, there is an info button called "possibleMoves", and by clicking on it, the interested party can see the available moves. The second party now also needs to pay the fee and join the contract, after which it needs to make a move. When both parties have made their moves, one needs to click on "seeResult" in order to finalize the contract.
